            A coffee with ice, typically served with a dash of milk, cream or
            sweetenerâ€”iced coffee is really as simple as that. Iced coffee
            fanatics know that whipping up this delicious drink at home is
            tricky, so you'll want to try a Hyperchiller to master your DIY iced
            coffee recipe.

          <p>
            Like an iced coffee, iced espresso can be served straight or with a
            dash of milk, cream or sweetener. You can also ice speciality
            espresso-based drinks like americanos, mochas, macchiatos, lattes
            and flat whites.

        <section class="main-section" id="Cold Brew">
          <header>#Cold Brew</header>
          <img src="images/coldbrew_1200X1200.jpg" alt="Coffee" />
          <p>
            The trendiest of the iced coffee bunch, cold brew coffees are made
            by steeping coffee beans from anywhere between 6-36 hours, depending
            on how strong you would like your cold brew. Once the beans are done
            steeping, add cold milk or cream.

        <section class="main-section" id="Frappuccino">
          <header>#Frappuccino</header>
          <img src="images/frapp-2_1200X1200.jpg" alt="Coffee" />
          <p>
            Made famous by Starbucks, the Frappuccino is a blended iced coffee
            drink that's topped with whipped cream and syrup. But not all Frapps
            are made the same: watch out for coffee-free versions. Unless you're
            into that sorta thing.

        <section class="main-section" id="Nitro">

          <p>
            A cold brew + nitrogen bubbles = a cold brew coffee with a frothy,
            Guinness-like consistency. (It's poured via a nitro tap, too.)

        <section class="main-section" id="Mazagran">

          <p>
            Maza-who?! Mazagran coffee is a cross between iced coffee, tea and
            your favorite rum drink. It typically consists of espresso, lemon,
            sugar and (sometimes) rum.
